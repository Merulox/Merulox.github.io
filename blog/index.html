    2023-09-02_19:38 This evening before I go to bed, I'm unplugging my computer for 2 months-- until at least December 3rd. I'm curious to see what'll happen to me without my biggest distraction. Saying this is a psychological experiment on myself sounds like it would be greatly overstating it, but it really is just that.

    <br>2023-09-02_16:23 I just got done making the website. I'm not sure how what I'll do for the blog format, but it'll stay as is for now.</p>
