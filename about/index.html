    <h3>personality</h3>
    <p>I may come off as intimidating at times because of the way I write, but I feel inferior to everyone I meet on the internet, so don't be shy. I know this one liner doesn't really say much about my personality, but I'm currently unable to write concisely about myself, so I'll leave it at that.</p>
